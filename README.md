## **What is QLED**?
QLED tvs are are televisions that use Quantum dot technology to make or deepen color.

## The general difference between the two.
* QLED technology uses an LED backlight to hit a screen of quantum dot particles that then supercharges the TVâ€™s pixels for brightness and color beyond the standard quality seen in other LCD TVs.
* UHD TVs are simply higher-resolution versions of the standard LCD TV. Both OLED and QLED TVs usually offer UHD resolution!
